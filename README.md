## Code Explaination
I chose to fulfil the requirements of the assignment by creating a space travel themed game. My code utilizes JavaScript to come up with random values and I created functions which did math and added values to the total. I utilized jquery methods in order to update the scores on the page in real time and event listeners to detect when an image was being clicked.
